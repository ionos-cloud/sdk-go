            the higher the load. The default weight is 1, and the maximal value is
            256. A value of 0 means the target VM will not participate in load-balancing
            but will still accept persistent connections. If this parameter is used
            to distribute the load according to target VM's capacity, it is recommended
            to start with values which can both grow and shrink, for instance between
            10 and 100 to leave enough room above and below for later adjustments.
