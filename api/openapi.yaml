    \ solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\"\
    \ (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API. \n\nThe API allows you to perform a variety\
    \ of management tasks such as spinning up additional servers, adding volumes,\
    \ adjusting networking, and so forth. It is designed to allow users to leverage\
    \ the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools\
    \ are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth\
    \ and intuitive."

        You can recreate a single Kubernetes Node.

        Managed Kubernetes starts a process which based on the nodepool's template creates & configures a new node, waits for status "ACTIVE", and migrates all the pods from the faulty node, deleting it once empty. While this operation occurs, the nodepool will have an extra billable "ACTIVE" node.

        weight:
          description: Weight parameter is used to adjust the target VM's weight relative
            to other target VMs. All target VMs will receive a load proportional to
            their weight relative to the sum of all weights, so the higher the weight,
            the higher the load. The default weight is 1, and the maximal value is
            256. A value of 0 means the target VM will not participate in load-balancing
            but will still accept persistent connections. If this parameter is used
            to distribute the load according to target VM's capacity, it is recommended
            to start with values which can both grow and shrink, for instance between
            10 and 100 to leave enough room above and below for later adjustments.

            If turned off, a target VM is always considered available. If turned on,
            the target VM is available when accepting periodic TCP connections, to
            ensure that it is really able to serve requests. The address and port
            to send the tests to are those of the target VM. The health check only
            consists of a connection attempt.
          type: boolean
        checkInterval:
          description: CheckInterval determines the duration (in milliseconds) between
            consecutive health checks. If unspecified a default of 2000 ms is used.
