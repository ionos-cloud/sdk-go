  description: "An enterprise-grade Infrastructure is provided as a Service (IaaS)\
    \ solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\"\
    \ (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API. \n\nThe API allows you to perform a variety\
    \ of management tasks such as spinning up additional servers, adding volumes,\
    \ adjusting networking, and so forth. It is designed to allow users to leverage\
    \ the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools\
    \ are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth\
    \ and intuitive."

        You can recreate a single Kubernetes Node.

        Managed Kubernetes starts a process which based on the nodepool's template creates & configures a new node, waits for status "ACTIVE", and migrates all the pods from the faulty node, deleting it once empty. While this operation occurs, the nodepool will have an extra billable "ACTIVE" node.
