```

Display API information

### Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    openapiclient "./openapi"
)

func main() {
    pretty := true // bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)
    depth := int32(56) // int32 | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
    xContractNumber := int32(56) // int32 | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)

    configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
    api_client := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
    resp, r, err := api_client.DefaultApi.ApiInfoGet(context.Background()).Pretty(pretty).Depth(depth).XContractNumber(xContractNumber).Execute()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error when calling `DefaultApi.ApiInfoGet``: %v\n", err)
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Full HTTP response: %v\n", r)
    }
    // response from `ApiInfoGet`: Info
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Response from `DefaultApi.ApiInfoGet`: %v\n", resp)
}
