## LocationsFindByRegionId

```go
var result Locations = LocationsFindByRegionId(ctx, regionId)
                      .Pretty(pretty)
                      .Depth(depth)
                      .XContractNumber(xContractNumber)
                      .Execute()
```

List Locations within a region

### Example

```go
package main

)

func main() {
    regionId := "regionId_example" // string | 
    pretty := true // bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)
    depth := int32(56) // int32 | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
